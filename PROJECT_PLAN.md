# üéÆ Gaming Library Microservices Project

A portfolio project to build a microservices-based web application for managing a personal video game library. Built with **Next.js** (frontend), **FastAPI** (backend), and **PostgreSQL** (database), using **IGDB.com** for game data.

---

## üß± Architecture & Infrastructure

- **API Gateway**

  - Routes frontend requests to appropriate microservices
  - Handles CORS, rate limiting, and authentication

- **Service Discovery / DNS**

  - Simple: Docker Compose hostnames
  - Advanced: Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes DNS

- **Containerization & Orchestration**

  - Docker for each service
  - Kubernetes or ECS for scaling (optional for MVP)

- **Configuration Management**
  - Environment variables (12-factor app)
  - Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

---

## üß† Backend Services

- **Auth Service**

  - JWT-based or OAuth2 authentication
  - Refresh-token flow and token revocation

- **User/Profile Service**

  - PostgreSQL schema migrations via Alembic
  - Profile endpoints, password hashing, email verification

- **Game Data Service**

  - IGDB API wrapper to abstract auth and rate limits
  - Caching layer (Redis) for frequent searches

- **Library Service**

  - CRUD operations on user‚Äôs game collections
  - Soft deletes, audit trail (optional)

- **Background Worker**
  - Celery or RQ for:
    - Periodic IGDB metadata sync
    - Sending notification emails

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Data & Caching

- **PostgreSQL**

  - Tables: users, games (local cache), collections, play sessions
  - Indexing for fast search and retrieval

- **Redis**
  - Cache for IGDB lookups
  - Optional: session storage

---

## üé® Frontend (Next.js)

- **State Management**

  - React Query or SWR for data fetching
  - Context or Redux for auth state

- **Routing & Auth Guards**

  - Next.js middleware for protected routes
  - Public vs. private route handling

- **Styling & Theming**
  - Tailwind CSS or styled-components
  - Dark mode toggle

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

- HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt
- Rate limiting per IP/user via API Gateway
- OWASP essentials: input validation, SQL injection protection, XSS
- Secure cookie flags: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Unit tests (pytest)
- Integration tests (FastAPI TestClient)
- End-to-end tests (Cypress or Playwright)
- Contract tests for service APIs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & DevOps

- **CI Pipeline**

  - Linting (flake8, ESLint), type checks (mypy, TypeScript)
  - Run tests, build Docker images

- **CD Pipeline**

  - Deploy to staging
  - Canary or blue/green deploys for production

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Centralized logs (Elastic Stack, Loki)
  - Metrics with Prometheus + Grafana
  - Health/readiness probes

---

## üìö Documentation & Developer Experience

- Auto-generated OpenAPI docs (FastAPI)
- Postman or Hoppscotch collections
- README with setup steps and architecture diagram

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Social features: friend lists, game recommendations

## Monorepo vs Multiple Repositories

Choosing between a monorepo (one repository) or polyrepo (multiple repositories) depends on trade-offs around complexity, collaboration, and deployment.

- Monorepo

  - Simplifies dependency management and versioning across services
  - One CI/CD pipeline, unified code reviews, and consistent tooling
  - Easier refactoring and cross-service changes
  - Can become unwieldy as the number of services grows

- Polyrepo
  - Clear service boundaries, smaller codebases per repo
  - Independent CI/CD pipelines and release cycles
  - Teams can work in isolation without stepping on each other
  - More overhead in coordinating versions, shared libraries, and cross-service changes
